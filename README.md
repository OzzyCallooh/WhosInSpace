> Did you know you can find out exactly who's in space right now?
> The Open Notify API provides that information. Visit
> <http://api.open-notify.org/astros.json> to see not only how many
> people are currently in space but also their names and which
> spacecraft they're on.
>
> Create a program that pulls in this data and displays the
information from this API in a tabular format.
